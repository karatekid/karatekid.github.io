Taiwan is an extremely beautiful and diverse country, for having such
a small amount of land with which to call home. In fact, Portugese
sailors once named Taiwan 'Formosa', which means 'Beautiful Island',
and a more suitable name I can not think of to describe the great
country that I had the privelege to stay in for two weeks.

### Getting to Taiwan

My adventure began as soon as I entered the airport for my flight to Taiwan. 
I arrived in the airport a little early, and while I was waiting for
my flight to arrive, a congenial foundation layer struck up a
conversation with me. We talked about where we were from and where we
were headed, and this conversation really set me up to be more
outgoing with others for the rest of my journey. Once I reached my
layover in Chicago, I boarded my plane and ended up having to wait
some more due to technical difficulties. I ended up talking with my
row-mate, who was a man named Shing from Taiwan. Our flight took off
eventually, and while everything seemed fine our flight ended up
having a very rare incident, someone had a medical emergency and we
ended up landing in Seattle so that they could get the proper medical
attention, I'm not sure what happened to them, but hopefully they
recovered.
