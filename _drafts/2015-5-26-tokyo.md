As I reluctantly left Taipei, I reminisced about all the great times
that I had had, and looked forward to the new experiences that I was
sure to experience. But, it wasn't without trepidation as the extent
of my isolation soon settled in; I would be travelling with out any
friends or acquantainces for about a week in a country where I didn't
speak the language. My nerves settled as I turned to my left and saw,
serenely surrounded by clouds, Mt. Fuji.
