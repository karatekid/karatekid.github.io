## Preface

I've recently embarked on a fool's errand of writing a book on Embedded Systems.
After getting propositioned to write a book about quadcopters for Arduinos, the
idea about writing a book just got more and more enticing. But, after I lost
contact with the publisher and was eventually passed up for another author I
realized that I still wanted to write a book, but now I could write about
whatever I wanted. After some brief contemplation on a rocky crevass, I realized
that I wanted to get more bare-bones and make a bridge between software
developers that are interested in hardware (Arduino tinkerers) and embedded
systems engineers. So, in that vein, I've begun reading, rereading, and
experimenting with different embedded systems books and projects to try to
collect a good chunk of my embedded systems knowledge into a cohesive unit from
which I can filter out some hopefully helpful insights and lessons. So, here's a
review of a book that I just read on embedded systems.
