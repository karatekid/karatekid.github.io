The observant reader may have noticed that I skipped a couple of days
in my last blog entry, that is because I'm trying to group my accounts
in a manner that seems sensible, and grouping by city seems to be a
good way of doing things right now. So, I'll discuss what I did before
I left for Tainan and then I'll wrap up my entries about Taiwan by
talking about what I did after Tainan.

## Before Tainan (5/15 - 5/16)
