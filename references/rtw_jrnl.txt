Saturday 5/9: leave, meet foundation layer from Florida, delayed in
ORD bathroom fixed, fly to Tokyo, but land in SEATAC because of
medical emergency, met Shing on flight, he's goint to TPE as well, so
we try to figure it out together and hang out for a while. EVA air
opens at 10, realize I need more paperwork get in end of line that
took 6 hours to clear, meet guy from marines, and an old player for
SRC. 

Sunday 5/10: sleep on plane

Monday 5/11: Andy picks up at TPE w/ Uncle, put stuff into day bag and
get on Train to Hualien??? with his aunt. Get there and raining, take
bus to bike area, still raining so get a taxi back to hotel, crazy
nice, right on the ocean front, amazing brunch thing. We walk down to visitor center and
just hang out until we take a bus into town. We walked around for
awhile trying out Mochi samples, we eventually sat down for some
noodles, we also got some Taiwan beer (very light), and some delicious 
snow ice. I know I went to bed at 7, I was super tired. 
The garbage trucks sound like ice cream trucks so people will 
bring out there trash.

Tuesday 5/12: Hsuia-Sheng arrives, 75th generation descendant of
Confuscius, disinherited for following beliefs about a sovereign
Taiwan. We eat a crazy breakfast, and then take a bus into town, we
try figuring out what to do, bus or car, can't really decide, then
eventually just get some bikes and go. We bike to Liyu Lake, it's 10
miles there and 10 miles back, some of the flattest biking I've ever
done and very beautiful country side. The lake was pretty cool, but
fairly small in my opinion to be seen as a cultural landmark. When
were heading back Hsuia-Sheng was tired so Andy's aunt and she got a
ride from a passing driver back to town, that allowed Andy and I to
bike back faster, and we had a pretty good time.

Wednesday 5/13: Tour bus to Taroko Gorge. I went to bed at 7, I was
super tired, Andy graciously grabbed me some dinner, I ate it and fell
right back asleep.

Thursday 5/14: Hike Old-Jhuilu Trail, go back to Hualien and then train to
Taipei and then Night market with Andy's Aunt and small celebration in
street. Then end up at Andy's Grandpa's place.

Friday 5/15: Film commercial for Aunt's cool invention that combines
wheelchair with bike. Night market with Hsuia-Sheng and walk to Taipei
101 and go to some book store thing. Watch a little TV because
home-sick slightly, ankle's very red.

Saturday 5/16: Bike around with family to lunch at NTU, get tour of
the campus, ride to an electronic sales outlet, Chang-Kai-Sek memorial
hall, learn how to play Chinese Chess, and a 5-player Euchre game. Get
some great spicy beef noodles (nyo-mien) and mango shaved ice.

Sunday 5/17: Get up early and go to Hsuia-Sheng's uncle's place in
Tainan (4 hour bus) with Andy, Hsuia-Sheng and Andy's cousin Tzu Ning. It was a
pleasant bus ride. Once we got to Hsuia-Sheng's uncle's place we were
fed well and then went to his massage parlor that had a couple of
empty floors above it which we ended up sleeping in, it was kind of
cool, they were basically mats in the middle of this abandonded floor
in a random building. After dropping our stuff off there we set out
around the city visiting an old Confuscius school and some fort that
the Dutch erected during their brief colonization of Taiwan. Some of
the buildings were quite exquisite, and a band actually started
playing outside one of them. I felt like we walked for quite a long
time before Hsuia-Sheng's uncle picked us back up. I was quite tired,
but we actually ended up singing Karaoke at her Uncle's place.
One of the best parts was when they were singing a song from the
Titanic and the background video was basically a soft-core porno. 

Monday 5/18: We woke up sweating, it was quite balmy in the upper
floors of the massage parlor. Once we had fully woken we were whisked
to a quick breakfast of boiled meat and rice, then dropped our bags
off at her uncle's place and started roaming the streets again. We
visited a cool Banyan tree house and another ancient fort. We had a
lot more great food, including oyster dishes and some sort of
soy-based desert. It felt like we just kept on eating, because when we
went back we played some more card games and then Hsuia-Sheng cooked
for us, it was quite delicious. We finally got on a train to
Kaohsiung, and arrived at a pretty nice hotel. Andy was pretty upset
about his dad being over inquisitive after I proposed going to Kenting
because Catherine was there. We also played a game called Gong Zhu. I
also learned "lee yua nguyen ediar", which means leave me alone. 

Tuesday 5/19: We arose in a lovely air conditioned room that felt like
a pleasant change from the previous night's warm excursion. After a
slow start we grabbed a quick continental breakfast in the upper floor
of the hotel and then we were off. We went to a pleasant art exhibit
that Catherine recommended, it was really interesting. A lot of the
exhibits were put together by the students and they seemed very
professional in their design and execution. There was even a section
with possible inventions, these seemed fairly innovative if a bit far
fetched. We then walked around for quite awhile, which got me used to
my full pack's load. We ended up eating at the Taiwanese McDonald's
called "Dan Dan Hanbao". It was far better than McDonald's. We then
walked around some more and ended up passing throug a long tunnel
through the mountain on the east side of the city. On the other side
we reached the university. It was very beautiful, reminding me of
coastal colleges in the states. We went to the beach and lounged
around for a while, before strolling back towards campus to meet
Andy's cousin, Yu Shuen. She was very quiet and proceeded to walk us
around the beautiful campus, before I knew it we were at the top of
the mountain, hiking up steep trails. Once we got to the top we walked
laterally for awhile and actualy came upon a family of monkeys that
seemed quite used to the human appearance while still being cautious
and retreating to the trees. On a similar note, there were a fair
amount of stray dogs lingering about campus, far more than in other
cities I have seen, perhaps due to the presence of the college
students? After our long, hot walk, we stopped in a quaint little
restaurant wher I once again partook of the glory that is "Nyo Mien" beef
noodle soup, oh man it was good! After that we walked back to the
train station and got on an express train back to Taipei for around
$40 USD, and it took ~2 hours in comparison to the 4 hour bus and 1
hour train ride which cost $8 and $3 respectively, all very reasonably
priced to traverse the entirety of this lovely island country.

Wednesday 5/20: Rain day 

Thursday 5/21:Bike ride to Tamsui & Andy's Mom's side dinner

Friday 5/22: Narrating Andy's Dad's side dinner

Saturday 5/23: Flights, and hostel stay

Sunday 5/24: Intentionally got lost, stopped in a library for WiFi, got
told off in Japanese ( no idea why),  ended up finding where I was
going, explored some museums, talked to a Korean journalist about
Hemingway and proofread a book he was writing when he was a journalist
in Afghanistan, and randomly ordered food at a sushi bar 

Monday 5/25: Akihabara!, 47 ronin, Yoyogi, Golden Gai

Tuesday 5/26: Imperial palace, Hamarikyu, Chun Shui bubble tea,
		Hakone, meet Karl and Dyon, hang out and program and chat.

Wednesday 5/27: 12 mile hike. Lots of road, then beautiful stone path.
Slippery steps and Hakone shrine. Ate up at hostel again with Karl.

Thursday 5/28: Rode bus down to lake, took pirate cruise, rowed & went
back to Tokyo. Very tired when got back. New capsule, less private,
	 many more people because in Shinjuku

Friday 5/29: Very relaxing day. Went to Shinjuku-Gyoen garden and
walked and read; realizing that this is my vacation and I don't have
to run around like a chicken with my head cut off. I just walked
around looking at flowers and reading Asano's book. It was pretty
good even though it was riddled with mistakes, but at points it was
very poignant and evocative. I also did a fair amount of planning for
my trip before getting some sort of dumpling soup thing for dinner.

Saturday 5/30: Getting to Korea, after getting acquainted with the
hostel and spending some time talking to the friendly staff and
figuring out what to do, I embarked towards City Hall. Once I arrived,
I noticed that there was some sort of festival going on, so I
meandered around watching and enjoying the spectacle. I passed by the
two main statues in the central area and walked into the big temple
after purchasing some roasted chestnuts to ease the pang of my hunger,
they weren't very good. I then ended up walking down to the stream and
went around until my hunger got me to find a busy street market. I got
some pretty great cup-chicken and mung bean pancake. I then sat and
watched the fish for a while. Since I had to get up pretty early for
my flight, I went to bed early.

Sunday 5/31: I decided to see a Korean baseball game since I had heard
about the enthusiasm of the crowds, I wasn't dissapointed. Once I got
to the arena in Jamsil, and went to a couple of the wrong booths, once
I eventually purchased an $8 ticket, for what I think was a general
admission area, I walked around looking at all of the different food
vendors and fans. There were a plethora of options and a variety of
people, I ended up grabbing a couple of spicy chicken kabobs with rice
cakes. They were exceedingly delicious. Watching the game was pretty
interesting, they were a lot of chants and people were able to bring
food from outside the venue, so it was almost like families were
having picnics while watching a baseball game. After the game, I
walked around the area and it was quite lively (especially after the
game). There were a lot of barbecue places. I then went back to
Hapjeong and went for a little walk. I ended up at Hongik university
after following a crowd of people after I turned a corner I was
enamored with the sight of throngs of people moving about from street
vendor to entertainer, enjoying the night. I walked around for awhile,
watching dance performances and listening to some wonderful singing 
voices (they are taught from an early age how to sing). I then grabbed
some Tektbotti and Kalbi Mondo (short rib beef dumplings) and had
dinner. I ended up meeting most of the people from the hostel, and we
got a couple of drinks, I my first bottle of Soju (which tasted like
watered-down vodka). We talked for awhile, the 3 irishmen, the
englishman, the Floridian, the Californian and I. We played King's cup
briefly and I retired after feeling the dubious effects of the Soju.

Monday 6/1: Hostel tour, lots of $$$ food, completely different
dynamic.
Monday 6/1: I was planning on visiting Bukansan after I checked out,
but my plans soon changed after talking with Fabian and Allison and
deciding to go on a walking tour of Seoul with them. They wanted to go
to City Hall and I was more than happy to oblige. We ended up getting
there (they had some issues with tickets, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND GETTING A
TCARD wherever you are going). After walking for only a short time,
we ran into Michael and Stuart from the hostel, an englishman
and Scot who were vacationing from their work in Australia. We decided
to walk together and I was appointed unofficial tour guide for some
reason? 

This experience really helped to highlight the differences
between solo and group travel. When I'm travelling alone I really like
to keep a low profile and try to blend in while being respectful of
the area that I'm in. My travelling companions, especially Mike and
Stu who were seasoned travellers (being to Peru, along with many other
locations) didn't seem to share my concern. They were really trying to
squeeze every last drop of enjoyment and hilarity out of our trip, and
it was intriguing to see this different approach to travel. We also
spent a great deal more on food than I usually do, but it was nice to
be able to share my experiences with other people, get out of my own
head and relish in their perspectives and stories. We also did a fair
bit of day drinking, which was definitely interesting. Stu and Mike
actually stole chopsticks from one of the places we went for barbecue.
But it definitely is nice to eat with people since you can try a wide
variety of dishes.

We walked up to the Seoul tower, the hike offered some stunning views 
of the city, which was much bigger than I had imagined. We also went
up for only 8,000 won. The sight wasn't much better from the mountain.
Stu and Mike kept drinking, and Stu told me some pretty interesting
stories. We ended up getting back to the hostel and relaxing for
awhile. Then we met up with a friend of Allison's from Korea and went
to get some Chi-Mec a great combination of beer and chicken. Koreans
certainly know how to fry their chicken, damn. We were accompanied by
one of the new hostel people, Maria. She was from Germany and had been
on break for 2.5 years, whoah. She told us about some of her escapades
with violent taxi drivers in Vietnam. I had to go meet dollar, so I
ducked out early and made my way over and slept on his floor after
talking with him and his roomate Kasey for a little while.

Tuesday 6/2: I pretty much just relaxed and recuperated from my
eventful day the day before and worked on my blog.

Wednesday 6/3: I decided to hike around Mt. Bukansahn today. It took
about an hour to get there from the city. The hike was great. The
initial part was a very relaxed slope and paved. That took me to a
fork in the trail where I went to one of the lower peaks, which
started with a D. It offered quite a nice view. I hiked back down from
there and hiked up to the highest peak. It was an interesting hike, I
was on all fours for part of it because it was so steep. Once I made
it to the top my breath was taken away by the incredible view, it far
surpassed the view from the Seoul tower, which was actually visible
from the peak, and seemed very insignificant in the distance. I hung
out around there for awhile, and really enjoyed the wind and view.
When I came back down there were probably about 200 army trainees
ascending wearing heavy packs. We got an interesting cheesy rice and
meat dinner to eat, it was pretty great.

Thursday 6/4: Today I chose to just relax. I wandered about Yonsei
University and read the Hitchiker's guide to the galaxy. It was a
pretty relaxing day, but I did feel let down by my lack of
productivity, or is it activity? Later at night, we got some dinner
and ended up drinking and watching a movie, a pretty normal day I
suppose (if I wasn't on vacation).

Friday 6/5: Like most things, the momentum from the previous day
continued and I chose to wander around Ewha Women's University and eat
some street food. It was pretty enjoyable and I read the next book in
the hitchiker's saga. Later at night I actually got some planning
done, which felt quite rewarding. (We were going to go to Sokcho, but
ended up not doing that.)

Saturday 6/6: We decided to visit Yongmasan & Achasan Mts. today. They
are on the SE part of Seoul, and while not as big or foremiddable as
Bukansahn, they do offer some very spectacular views while practically
being within the city, and the climb isn't very hard at all. I went
from Yongmasan to Achasan and then descended. Casey and Dollar went
down after reaching the peak at Yongmasan. The rest of the hike was
very populated, and there were actually food and supply vendors along
the hike. Once getting off the trail there was a children's park with
a zoo and a cool musical fountain. We then walked around the college
restaurant area, and got a very spicy skillet ramen with chicken. We
came back and Dollar and Casey went to bed early.

Sunday 6/7: Incheon, Soju, & Nurebong.

Monday 6/8: I had a late start considering the previous night's
affairs. But, after having a rice, beef, and jalapeno sandwich, and
catching up on GOT. I set off for Gwanaksan, which is near New Seoul
University. I got there and set out on my hike, it took me to very
rocky terrain with breathtaking scenery. At one point, I ventured to
free climb a certain area, but thought better of my safety. After
reaching the bottom at dusk, I got some great street food from 2
kindly older women: mung-bean pancake and fish on a stick. It only
cost 4,000 won. Once I reached the Sinchon station I procured a waffle
for 1,500 won; the purveyor smeared it in a blueberry cream of some
sort, sprinkled peanuts, walnuts, honey and some sort of powder. The
result was superb, and right before I got home there was a very
glorious street performance being sung by no less than 20 people, it
was very invigorating.

Tuesday 6/9: I had to wait around to talk to the SFO guys about apt.
hunting; after that I got some ramen and did a little research. I
eventually made it out to Inwangsan Mtn. for a really spectacular view
and an off-beat trail. I'm kind of surprised that I was able to find
the trail, it seemed off the beaten path. 

Wednesday 6/10: Bike around Hangang

Thursday 6/11: Rest	

Friday 6/12: Tentacle

Saturday 6/13: I woke early in the morning and packed all of my
belongings back into my backpack. I did all of the standard stuff, so
that in a couple of hours I was exiting customs at Beijing Airport. I
then met Daniel's friend, Zach who had run to meet me. His level of
hospitality was overwhelming, and we were soon chatting like old
friends, if slightly stilted by a language barrier. He helped guide me
through the haranguing issues of the Beijing underground and we were
soon dropping my bag off at my hostel. We then went to a restaurant
that he had looked up, it was closed but we we dipped into a nearby
hole in the wall and had a plethora of great dumplings of shrimp and
pork along with tofu side dishes. At one point, shortly after telling 
tales of my acclompishments
with chopsticks, I proceeded to drop a dumpling right into my spicy
oil and splattered my clothes with oil much to my own embarassment,
the worst part was all of the help that Zach was offering. Shortly
thereafter, we navigated a maze of public transportation to reach the
unexpected splendor of the Summer Palace. It was really nice and we
ended up walking behind the big area to get a view. Afterwards, we
decided to gourge ourselves upon the delicacies of the chinese
cuisine. We had mushrooms, cold spicy oil chicken, spicy beef, a sort
of flan fish, red bean cubes, fried shrimp, and fried plum balls. It
was great. Zach, Monica, and I ended up parting ways. Their
hospitality is very strong, we basically fought to pour tea for each
other. I was talking to Zach about the problems that face trouble and
he identified one of the biggest issues as education, which I totally
agree with.

Sunday 6/14: Temple of Heaven, Peking duck, Tianan'men square,
	   Forbidden City
In the wee hours of the morning I woke to find that my nausea had
subsided from the previous night's vomitus regurgitus. I debated with
myself whether to tell Zach or not and decided to not, thinking that
he would either be overly apologetic or worried. So we took a couple
of buses until we arrived at the Temple of Heaven, a ceremonial
Chinese area where Emperors of yesteryear would conduct significant
rituals and the like. Zach sneakily purchased an audio guide that used
gps to provide "insightful" tourism points, I didn't quite think it
was worth it. The inside of the park that housed the temples was very
beautiful and some groups of women were doing some sort of dance and
singing perhaps. There was also an interesting beanbag game with a
feather that looked interesting. Afterwards, Zach and I went closer to
Tianan'men area and got some green tea ice cream and wandered around
the area until our table was ready at a peking duck area. We met two
more of Danyang's friends and went to the silk store that makes the 
Chinese flag. We then went to a very old and popular chinese medicine
store, which was quite interesting. The Peking duck was incredible and
we rolled it in very thin pieces of flour (I think) and dipped it in
duck sauce, sugar, and cucumbers. It was very delicious. There was
also plenty of other foods, including a very delicious grilled lamb,
and noodles. Tianan'men square was auspiciously large and surrounded
by security checkpoints to ensure that nothing was damaged in protests
to the government. The forbidden city was exceedingly large and
beautiful, we mostly wandered around outside, but were offered the
occasional glance into a temple or two. Apparently, the emperor had a
whole section of the palace devoted to concubines, who could basically
work their way into high ranking positions. We then walked through a
heavily populated area where we got Hugosi snacks that had a variety
of tastes. I tried cow lung, not too bad, but very chewy. We then
walked around some more and saw a very beautiful area with a large
pond.


Monday 6/15: Badaling great wall and Olympic stadium
I met Zach at the BeijingBei Station and there was a long line to get
tickets to get onto the train to Badaling. After waiting in line, Zach
talked to one of the security guards and grabbed me and Felicia, one
of Zach's close friends and we simply used our transit cards to get in
and sat on the floor of the train, which took about 1.5 hours to get
to Badaling. Once there, we embarked on the north portion of the wall.
What really struck me was the amount of people rather than the wall,
which stretched up and over the surrounding mountains. The amount of
people made it kind of difficult to get around, but once we got to the
peak, far less people continued until the terminal 12th fortress,
which involved some quite precipitous steps, but Felicia and I
continued on. We ended up back in Beijing and went to a restaurant
that had some really spicy jello sort of thing and a scheme where we
got a bunch of food on sticks and they basically put it in a pot of
oil and then gave that to us, which we hapilly ate. Some of the more
exotic things that I had included rabbit liver, cow lung, See you
tomorrow (a mushroom named for seeing it in poop?!), and heart of
?rabbit?. We then went to the olympic stadium, Zach got on the wrong
train because he was rushing and we ended up catching up with him at
the next station. One of the things that struck me was how up to date
they were with American celebrities, movies, and tv. We said some
painful goodbyes and parted ways. I think I may have left too soon.

Tuesday 6/16: Card lost, travel, sick, and plan
I woke up early to catch my bullet train to Shanghai, unfortunately
there was a little mix up in the morning. When I went to leave and
grab my card from the outlet on the wall, which required a card to
allow it to operate, the loud argentinians, declared that it was their
card. Not having time to argue with them, and not being able to find
their card or any possible place that "my" card could have gone I
proceeded to the front desk with the large argentinian in tow. I ended
up just leaving my security deposit of 100 yen, which was more than an
extra night's stay. I was not a happy camper. I left them my email
address in case they found the card, but I recommend that if you ever
stay in a dorm either don't use your card in this situation, use a
different card, or label your card in some distinctive manner.

After that sour start I proceeded to the train station, I was not 
feeling that well and had a slight head cold that morning. During the
train ride, I slept a fair amount and took in the beautiful
countryside. When we finally arrived in Shanghai, I took a quick
subway to my hostel. When I stepped out of the underground, it was
raining. I wandered around, trying to find my hostel, and eventually
came across it and checked in. By that time, my head cold had turned
into an all out sneeze fest. I ended up doing a lot of planning that
day and not much else.

Wednesday 6/17: Sick, walk around city, meet Brennan
I awoke not feeling much better, and did some more planning. 
While I was planning an asian guy approached me and noted that I was
sneezing and had a bit of a cold. He then proceeded to ask me
questions by typing chinese into a translation app and showing me the
questions. At one point he asked if I had a girlfriend, when I replied
no, he quickly asked if I had a boyfriend. I laughed and said no, but
I was getting a vibe from him that made me feel uneasy. I went back to
planning whilst sneezing.

After a while I was feeling slightly better and decided to walk around the
city and see the bund that I had heard so much about. (At this point I
had tried to contact my friend Simon, who was in Shanghai at the time,
but he never responded). The bund was fairly impressive, with a decent
view of the buildings across the river. I walked from the tip to the
tail of the bund and then walked around the city, tasting various
exotic flavors of chips, like lamb chutney or italian meat. All the
while it was raining, and not exactly helping to stop the cold that
was growing within me. I eventually returned to the hostel and when I
walked in I met a personable young man named Brennan who had been
teaching in Vietnam, India, and Nepal. We walked and talked for a
while, grabbing some food along the way. One particularly delicious
morsel was a type of candied bacon. Brennan thought my future plans
were really cool and he helped to boost my ego.
