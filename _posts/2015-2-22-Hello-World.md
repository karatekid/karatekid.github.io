I just switched over from using Hexo to blog which a node based
blogging platform to Jekyll which seems to have a much larger user
community.

I've left the rest of this post in here for future reference.

Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below :point_down:).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
