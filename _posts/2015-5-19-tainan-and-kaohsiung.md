## Tainan (5/17 - 5/18)

Forces had been conspiring around Andy and I, mainly his aunt and
Hsuia-Sheng, and they contrived to send us to Tainan, the home of her
uncle's. So, before we knew it Andy and I were being whisked away on a
bus to Tainan, along with Hsuia-Sheng and Andy's Cousin Tzu-Ning. We
got there and immediately shared a delicious shaved ice to help combat
the heat. Eventually, Hsuia-Sheng's uncle picked us up and we were fed
even more delicious food at his home. On the way, I was surprised to see 
a Costco; it seemed drastically out of place. After we were recovered
from our travels we were dropped off at our accomodations for the
night, a spare room above the massage parlor that Hsuia-Sheng's uncle
owned. It was very spartanesque, containing simple mats in the middle
of an abandoned floor; I loved it.

We then set out into the city, visiting several cultural sites
including a store that had been bombed in the war, a museum of sorts,
an old Confuscius school, and a fort that had been constructed by the
Dutch during their brief colonization. The fort looked quite beautiful
from the outside.

We continued walking for awhile and ended up going
back to Hsuia-Sheng's uncle's place and sang Karaoke, which is
apparently quite popular here. The funniest part was when a
song from the Titanic came on and the background video took on a
highly suggestive nature, highlighting some of the absurdities of
Taiwanese KTV. We eventually ended up above the massage parlor and
quickly fell asleep from our long day in Tainan.

We woke up sweating, it was quite balmy in the upper
floors of the massage parlor. Once we had fully woken we were whisked
to a quick breakfast of boiled meat and rice, then dropped our bags
off at her uncle's place and started roaming the streets again.

We visited a cool Banyan tree house and another ancient fort. We had a
lot more great food, including oyster dishes and some sort of
soy-based desert. It felt like we just kept on eating, because when we
went back we played some more card games and then Hsuia-Sheng cooked
for us, it was quite delicious. Afterwards, we joked around for awhile
and Hsuia-Sheng made a very funny impression of Japanese girls on tv
that overappreciated food. We eventually parted with Hsuia-Sheng, and
her very accomodating family and got on a train to
Kaohsiung, and arrived at a pretty nice hotel.

## Kaohsiung (5/19)

We arose in a lovely air conditioned room that felt like
a pleasant change from the previous night's warm excursion. After a
slow start we grabbed a quick continental breakfast in the upper floor
of the hotel and then we were off. We went to a new art exhibit
that a friend of mine  recommended, it was really interesting. A lot of 
the exhibits were put together by the students and they seemed very
professional in their design and execution. There was even a section
with possible inventions, these seemed fairly innovative if a bit far
fetched.

We ended up eating at the Taiwanese McDonald's
called "Dan Dan Hanbao". It was far better than McDonald's. We then
walked around some more and ended up passing throug a long tunnel
through the mountain on the east side of the city. On the other side
we reached the university.

It was very beautiful, reminding me of
coastal colleges in the states. We went to the beach and lounged
around for a while, before strolling back towards campus to meet
Andy's cousin, Yu Shuen. She was very quiet and proceeded to walk us
around the beautiful campus, before I knew it we were at the top of
the mountain, hiking up steep trails. Once we got to the top we walked
laterally for awhile and actualy came upon a family of monkeys that
seemed quite used to the human appearance while still being cautious
and retreating to the trees. On a similar note, there were a fair
amount of stray dogs lingering about campus, far more than in other
cities I have seen, perhaps due to the presence of the college
students?

After our long, hot walk, we stopped in a quaint little
restaurant where I once again partook of the glory that is "Nyro Mien" 
beef noodle soup, oh man it was good! After that we walked back to the
train station and got on an express train back to Taipei for around
$40 USD, and it took ~2 hours in comparison to the 4 hour bus and 1
hour train ride which cost $8 and $3 respectively, all very reasonably
priced to traverse the entirety of this lovely island country.
